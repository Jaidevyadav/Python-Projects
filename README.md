<b>Problem Faced</b><br>
I had some problem installing pip commands</br> like <b>pip install pypdf2</b> (to read data from pdf file)
<b>pip install pyaudio</b> (c++ library interfacing with audio drivers)</br>
Both of these commands required me to reinstall whole visual studio.</br>
pip install pyttsx3 (text to speech conversion)</br>
this was also pain, but it worked at end.</br>
also the audio is low and it's not audible clearly.</br>
voice read even dots and blank spaces which is annoying not fun at all.
