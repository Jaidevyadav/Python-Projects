<b>Problem Faced</b>
I had some problem installing pip commands
like pip install pypdf2 (to read data from pdf file)
pip install pyaudio (voiceover)
Both of these commands required me to reinstall whole visual studio.
pip install pyttsx3 (text to speech conversion)
this was also pain.
but it worked at end.
also the audio is low and it's not audible clearly.
voice read even dots and blank spaces which is annoying not fun at all.
