# Python-Projects
Some practice projects
it reads data from a pdf file and reads it.

code is simply taken from youtube video.
original author : https://github.com/ProgrammingHero1/audiobook
had some problem installing pip commands
like pip install pypdf2
pip install pyaudio
this commad requiered me to reinstall whole visual studio again
pip install pyttsx3
this was also pain.
but it worked at end.
also the audio is low and it's not that great.
voice read even dots and break which is annoying not fun at all.
